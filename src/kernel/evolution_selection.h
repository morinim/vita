/// Tournament selection is a method of selecting an individual from a

/// among a few individuals chosen *at random* from the population. The

/// for crossover.
///
/// Selection pressure is easily adjusted by changing the tournament size.
/// If the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller chance
/// to be selected.
/// A 1-way tournament selection is equivalent to random selection.
///
/// Tournament selection has several benefits: it's efficient to code, works
/// on parallel architectures and allows the selection pressure to be easily
/// adjusted.

/// The tournament selection algorithm we implemented was modified so that
/// instead of having only one winner (parent) in each tournament, we select
/// `n` winners from each tournament based on the top `n` fitness values in the
/// tournament.
